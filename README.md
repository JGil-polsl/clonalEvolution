# Introduction

Python software for simulating celluar/microbial clonal evolution with Gillespie algorithm usage

# Installation and Usage

The simpliest installation:
```
python -m pip install clonalEvolution
```

Usage in python:
```
from clonalEvolution import mainView
mainView.run()
```

Usage from console:
```
python -m clonalEvolution 
#   for simply run graphic verion of software

python -m clonalEvolution -h
#   to see instructions for command line parametrization
``` 

# Usage Instructions

file name - used in multiple functions: saving files, plots, parameters; specify name of file (according to windows acceptable characters), data files will have cycle number (name_number.csv/.txt) \
file path - used in multiple functions: saving files, plots, parameters; specify absolute path to folder where simulation data should be saved \
file description - 'TODO' add description in params/data file about simulation specyfied by user \
\
clone diagram - button, fire the muller plot creation. It is needed to specify path with muller plot data generated from simulaiton \
file structure (file-name_muller_plot_'binned'_data.txt): 

```
clone, cells, previous clone
(0, 5000, 0)
```

mutations histograms - button, fire the VAF plot creation for all clones in specified file. File is needed to be one of generated simulation data \
file structure (file-name_cycle.csv/.txt):

```
,Clone number,Cells number,Mean fitness,Mean mutation number,Driver mutation list,Passener mutation list,Previous clone number
0,0,5000,1,0,[],[],0
```

select which files should be saved automaticaly after one cycle specified in parameters (skip). Not all types works for both algorithm versions 'TODO'
